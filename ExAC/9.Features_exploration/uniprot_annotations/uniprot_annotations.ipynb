    "3. List of canonical proteins for each gene\n",
    "4. Match data for each canonical protein (start position, end position, and target sequence)\n",

    "The output is a dictionary that has the Uniprot annotations for each position per gene per domain. Positions are indices in the target sequence (0 indicates the first amino acid, etc.)"
