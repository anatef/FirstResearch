4. Go to: http://grch37.ensembl.org/biomart/
   Select "Ensembl Gene" database
   Select "Homo sapiens genes (GRCh37.p13)" dataset
   Go to "Attributes" and open the "structures" tab
   Select the following: "Ensembl Gene ID", "Ensembl Transcript ID", "Ensembl Protein ID", "Chromosome Name", "Strand", 
   "Exon Rank in Transcript", "Genomic coding start", "Genomic coding end".
   Save the results (check Unique results only) to: "Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.genelocs.tsv".

5. Go to: http://grch37.ensembl.org/biomart/
   Select "Ensembl Gene" database
   Select "Homo sapiens genes (GRCh37.p13)" dataset
   Go to "Attributes" and open the "features" tab
   Select the following: "Ensembl Gene ID", "Ensembl Protein ID", "HGNC ID", "HGNC Symbol", "Associated Gene Name".

8. Run the genAllProts.py code: "python genAllProts.py".
   Each run set "True/False" for one code section in "MAIN" 
   In the order written in the code:
   1) Update FASTA file with alternate IDs.
   2) Process the big FASTA file of the "dna_sm.toplevel".
   3) Verify all sequnces againds the gene locations.
   Note: #3 takes a long time (several hours).

9. Run the script: "prot.pa_concate.ipynb" to create a big file of all the prot.pa files.

10. Run the script: "exons.txt_concate.ipynb" to create a zip of all the exons within their gene directories.
