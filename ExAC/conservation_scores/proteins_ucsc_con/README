100-way vertebrate whole genome alignment from UCSC genome browser:

1. Extracted sections corresponding to protein exons.
2. Stiched the exons together and translated them to proteins -> 100-way protein alignment.
3. For each column, JSD was calculated on the column and BLOSUM62 background frequency (higher JSD = greater conservation).
4. Values of JSD were multiplied by the fraction of non-gapped residues in a column (as the JSD was calculated only on the non-gapped residues). 


JSD files format:
=================
3 tab-delimited columns:
[0] the 0-index of the protein sequence
[1] the residue in the human protein (for sanity check)
[2] the JSD score
